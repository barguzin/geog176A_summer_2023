## What so special about spatial? 

> Can you think of an activity today that required spatial thinking? 

::: {.incremental}

- Locating a bathroom / kitchen / fridge in the house 
- Getting to school (biking / walking / driving), aka 'navigation' 
- Choosing your seat in this classroom / parking spot

## Geographic Information Science and Systems 

> **GI Systems** - computer-based tools for collecting, storing, processing, analyzing and visualizing geographic information. Learn more about what GIS is from [ESRI Website](https://www.esri.com/en-us/what-is-gis/overview). 

> **GI Science** - field of knowledge concerned with concepts, principles and methods utilized by GI Systems. Provides a framework for creating new evidence-based knowledge about the Earth.
